Xvinc is a powerful executor for roblox. 


Enable Logging : Enable if you want to log crashes or errors. 

At the moment, only Opera GX and Chrome are supported, due to numerous incompatibilites with the way Xvinc works. This is an executor for the web version of roblox, and it loads itself into the browser.

Antiviruses will flag this program. It is up to you if you want to run it. If you don't, you don't. 

I am not held liable for anything that happens to your roblox account, as you are downloading an exploit, which is against the Roblox TOS.
